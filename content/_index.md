**Over "lockdown" I set myself the goal to learn to build and deploy a website for two reasons:**

1. **To learn how to build and share websites.**

2. **To have a platform to capture what I am learning in my own time. As well as building a knowledge base for myself and sharing my knowledge with others, I have found this website to also be a good motivation to continue to explore the topics I am interested in.**


**Currently my interests are in extracting information from imagery and LiDAR. In the articles of this website I will be outlining the techniques I am learning to do just that.**

**If you would like to discuss the content of this website please get in touch at simon.planzer@gmail.com**
