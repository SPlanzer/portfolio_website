## Objective
Having explored conventional methods for feature extraction from satellite imagery as part of recent academic studies I am currently investing my time into how to utilise machine learning and particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify geographic features.

I am particularly interested in leveraging PyTorch for this purpose.
